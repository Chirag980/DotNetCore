## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and set up your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (latest version)
- Visual Studio 2022 (or any other preferred IDE)
- Basic understanding of C# and web development concepts

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aspnet-learning-project.git
    cd aspnet-learning-project
    ```

2. **Open the Solution in Visual Studio:**

    Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio to explore the project structure.

3. **Restore Dependencies:**

    Visual Studio will automatically restore the NuGet packages. If not, you can do so manually by right-clicking on the solution and selecting "Restore NuGet Packages."

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- **ASP.NET MVC:** A framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications using the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
- **ASP.NET Core MVC:** A lightweight, cross-platform version of ASP.NET MVC, designed to work with modern web technologies.
- **Razor Pages:** A simplified framework for building web applications, focusing on a page-based programming model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key sections:

- **Controllers:** Handles incoming requests, processes user input, and returns appropriate responses.
- **Views:** Contains the Razor views responsible for rendering HTML content.
- **Models:** Defines the data structure and business logic for the application.
- **wwwroot:** Contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **Pages:** Used for Razor Pages, offering a page-centric way of building web applications.

## How to Run

1. **Build the Solution:**

    Use Visual Studio to build the solution. This will compile all the projects and ensure that everything is set up correctly.

2. **Run the Application:**

    Press `F5` in Visual Studio or use the `dotnet run` command in the terminal.

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

3. **Access the Application:**

    Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the application.

## Learning Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To gain hands-on experience with ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core MVC, and Razor Pages.
- To understand the differences and similarities between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core MVC.
- To learn how to build scalable, maintainable, and testable web applications.
- To explore best practices for structuring and organizing a web application.
- To experiment with Razor Pages for simpler web application development.
